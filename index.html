            <h3>YOGA AS A WEAPON</h3><br>
            <p >
              Doing some yoga or gentle stretching every day is a powerful weapon against anxiety and depression and can help you feel more centered, Dr. Williams says. Plus, yoga has been shown to offer physical benefits, including a stronger immune system, less inflammation, more energy, less chronic pain, stronger muscles, improved balance, and better heart health. And for those who struggle with fatigue, you can energize with yoga.

The best part? You don’t have to be a yogi, go to a fancy retreat, or do hours of hot yoga every day to get all these benefits. And forget the myth that you have to be ultra-flexible to do yoga.
“Even if you do just 15 to 30 minutes a day, you start to see improvements,” Dr. Williams says, adding that the key is to do what feels best for your body rather than attempting all the acrobatic poses you see on Instagram. In fact, simply sitting and doing focused breathing exercises is a form of yoga. You can also give these morning yoga stretches a try.

To help inspire you to hit the mat (or just a comfy spot on your floor).

          Peace of any sort can be hard to come by these days. But no matter what’s in the news or happening around you, you can use yoga to find a sense of inner peace.
          Some workouts can leave you feeling exhausted afterward. But yoga usually leaves you feeling energized and recharged, making it the perfect way to start your day. As soon as you hop out of bed, start with these energizing morning stretches to jump-start your day.You don’t have to know a downward-facing dog from an upward-facing dog to get started. People hear the funny names of the poses or see the intimidating-looking studios and think yoga is an exclusive club. It’s not, as shown by these easy yoga poses you can do every day.
          Back pain is one of the most common health complaints and can be one of the hardest to treat, Dr. Williams says. While yoga can’t fix a back injury (always talk to your doctor about back pain), it can help reduce pain and increase your core strength to take pressure off your back. If you suffer from back pain, make sure you’re avoiding these habits that are damaging your spine.</p>

         <h3>SURYA NAMASKAR</h3>
         <p>
          Surya Namaskar means "bowing down in reverence to the sun," and Namaskar means "bowing down in respect to the sun." This has been the most popular yogic kriya for decades, as it integrates 12 yoga asanas in a yogic sequence. Surya Namaskar is a daily practice that helps to balance three bodily constituents: Kapha, Pitta, and Vata, allowing you to manage your life better and affect your creativity and intuition talents. Its basic yet powerful positions make yoga accessible to individuals of all ages and sizes, at any time and in any location. In this article, our experts will guide you about the various aspects of Surya Namaskar, such as Surya Namaskar poses, Surya Namaskar benefits, disadvantages of Surya Namaskar, Surya Namaskar mantra, Surya Namaskar for weight loss, and much more.
          Sun salutation, also known as Surya Namaskar, is an ancient method consisting of a sequence of yoga asanas or positions performed to reverence the sun. The sun has always been revered throughout human history, and in Hindu mythology, the Sun-God, or Surya, is a symbol of good health and eternal life. According to the Rig Veda, the sun is the soul of both moving and non-moving entities.Surya Namaskar steps are divided into twelve postures or asanas performed one after the other in order. The asanas stretch the body while contracting and extending the chest alternately to control respiration. Surya Namaskar Yoga improves the flexibility of the spine and joints and the body's ability to shed excess fat when practised regularly. It also helps warm up the body in preparation for various asanas and yoga activities.Although there are many versions of the Surya Namaskar poses today, the most common ones are:
          <li>Pranamasana (Prayer pose)</li>
          <li>Hastauttanasana (Raised arms pose)</li>
          <li> Hastapadasana (Standing forward bend)</li>
          <li> Ashwa Sanchalanasana (Equestrian pose)</li>
          <li> Dandasana (Stick pose)</li>
          <li>Ashtanga Namaskara (Salute with eight parts)</li>
          <li>Bhujangasana (Cobra pose)</li>
          <li>Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward facing dog pose)</li>
          <li> Ashwa Sanchalanasana (Equestrian pose)</li>
          <li> Hastapadasana (Standing forward bend)</li>
          <li> Hastauttanasana (Raised arms pose)</li>
          <li> Tadasana (Mountain Pose)</li>

        <p><h4><a href="https://www.indiancentury.com/yoga.htm">RAJA YOGA MEDITATION </a></h4><br>In the Hindu religious and philosophic tradition, the yogic meditation has been an effective means for the spiritual uplift of man; it is expected to liberate him from earthly bondages and ultimately unite him with the Absolute Soul. In other religions as well, meditation is a higher form of prayer to commune with the divine. But for Hinduism, true to the writings of the Seers, meditation is the definitive method of discovering or realizing the Absolute in one’s own self. The Rishis developed a system of the holistic theory of the relationship between the individual self and the Universal Self, especially during the period of the Aranyakas and Upanishads. Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras give the systematic codification of the theory and practice of meditation based on the authentic Vedic traditions.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://indianculture.gov.in/unesco/intangible-cultural-heritage/yoga">INDIAN CULTURE OF YOGA</a></h3><br>
    <p>The philosophy behind the ancient Indian practice of yoga has influenced various aspects of how society in India functions, whether it be in relation to areas such as health and medicine or education and the arts. Based on unifying the mind with the body and soul to allow for greater mental, spiritual and physical wellbeing, the values of yoga form a major part of the community’s ethos. Yoga consists of a series of poses, meditation, controlled breathing, word chanting and other techniques designed to help individuals build self-realization, ease any suffering they may be experiencing and allow for a state of liberation. It is practised by the young and old without discriminating against gender, class or religion and has also become popular in other parts of the world. Traditionally, yoga was transmitted using the Guru-Shishya model (master-pupil) with yoga gurus as the main custodians of associated knowledge and skills. Nowadays, yoga ashrams or hermitages provide enthusiasts with additional opportunities to learn about the traditional practice, as well as schools, universities, community centres and social media. Ancient manuscripts and scriptures are also used in the teaching and practice of yoga, and a vast range of modern literature on the subject available.
