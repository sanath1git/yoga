            the ultimate goal of yoga is to be a better version of ourselves – to be healthier and happier. To achieve a new perspective on life and all that comes with it, to discover and embrace the true self and to appreciate every moment, and to live a happy, balanced and useful life. This would make a lot of sense to most of us as the word “yoga” itself means “to join or unite”, which implies joining or integrating all aspects of the individual body with mind and mind with soul.

Some yoga masters have described the ultimate goal of yoga as achieving a “higher state of being”. You might have heard of the word “moksha” which means Nirvana or the liberation from worldly suffering and the cycle of rebirth and reincarnation, leading to an enlightened relationship with the Creator. However, different yoga schools have different beliefs about this relationship.

                In addition to all the health benefits that yoga brings, it is good to remember that the true purpose or goal of yoga is not just for use on the yoga mat. Everything you learn is meant to be put to the test, out there in real life, especially when things get stressful or messy whether at work, at home, in your personal life or with friends.

                Here’s a little tip: To be able to reach our goal of yoga, we will need to commit to the discipline of the practice with blessings from our teacher. You will see that one is not possible without the other.
